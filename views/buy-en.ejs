From there, this information is forwarded to the Aegean Army Command to check the application request. This is because the sale of certain areas in Turkey to foreigners is prohibited.</p>
                    <p>According to the new law enacted in 2014, if at least one foreigner has purchased property on the same plot, other foreign citizens can receive their title deed on the same day without needing to apply again to the AEGEAN ARMY COMMAND.</p>
                    <p>‚è≥ Army permission approval takes approximately 3 months, and once approved, you can receive your title deed issued in your name from the title deed office or your lawyer.</p>
